
#Abstraction

- If method in a class don't have body it then must be declared as abstract'

      abstract void start();

 - A method without body (No implementation) is known as Abstract methods.

 - If class have any abstract method then class should be mark as abstract method.

 - Abstract classes can not be instantiated, we can not create object of an abstract class.

#Interface
- We can not create object of interface.
-Interface is used to achieve abstraction.
-Interface supports multiple inheritance/ Interface used multiple inheritance
-Interface used to achieve loose coupling.
-Interface is the blue print of the class which tells class what to do, but it does not show/tell class how to implement a particular task
-All the methods in abstract class are abstract methods

- We can not create concerte methods in interface
- All the methods in interface are public abstract types

-All the fields/variables in interface are by default public static final;

--->>>> In java 8 version

- We can create default conerate methods

     default display() {
        System.out.println("Display");
     }

  - We can create static methods inside interface.

     static void run(){
     System.out.println("I am running");
     }

--->>>> In java 9 version

 -In java 9 version we can use
 private void run() {

 }
# Syntax

interface InterfaceName {

  public abstract method();

  fileds;
