-Array is collection of homogenous data types

    - Index position of array is starts from 0 always.

    - In java array is consider as object as we have used 'new' keyword
    - If array is object then it must have the class (As every object is associated with class)

    - Super class of array is Object class

    - Array object occupies the memory inside the Heap memory (Heap area)

    - All object in java stores memory inside the Heap memory

    - Arrays are faster than the primitive data types.

    - The elements in an array are stored in consecutive memory locations.

    -Arrays are used to implement data structures like
       Linked List
       Stacks
       Queues
       Graphs

    # Disadvantages of arrays
      -Array has fixed size.
      -In array we can only store similar data types (Integer, String)

      -The elements in an array are stored in consecutive memory locations
       thus to delete an element in an array we need to traverse through whole
       array, this will reduce the performance.

 # Sorting : Arranging data in logical order whether it is ascending or descending order.

 There are total 6 Sorting algorithms:

   1) Bubble Sort
   2) Selection Sort
   3) Insertion Sort
   4) Merge Sort
   5) Heap Sort
   6) Quick Sort

1] Bubble Sort in Java

  - Bubble sort is comparison based algorithm which compares two adjusent element and sort elements in ascending or descending order.

  -> Number of Rounds = Number of elements in List - 1


# Selection Sort in java
  - Selection sort is combination of searching and sort
  - Selection sort algorithm maintains two sub arrays

     Sub array 1 : First array which is sorted.
     Sub array 2 : Second(Remaining) array which is unsorted.

# Searching Algorithms:

1] Linear Search

2] Binary Search


1] Linear Search :
    -In linear search algorithm a search is made all over the elements one by one.
     Every element is checked one by one and if element/match is found then that particular element is returned
     if match is not found then search continues till the end of list/array.


2] Binary Search :
   -Binary Search is faster than the liner search
   -To user binary search array should be sorted first
   -Binary Search is apply only on sorted array
   -Usually we use while loop in binary search
