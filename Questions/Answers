# Microservices

3)  If you have monoliths application what would be your approach to convert it to microservice application?

- 1) If we have monolithic application then identify all possible standalone functionalities
- 2) Once identified create separate stand alone project(Spring boot) for each functionalities.
- 3) For interactions between this services we need to implement way of communication between them
     either synchronous communication or asynchronous communication
- 4) Now we need to include components like service discovery, Eureka client and API gateway in cloud
     environment etc for proper functioning of these microservices.
