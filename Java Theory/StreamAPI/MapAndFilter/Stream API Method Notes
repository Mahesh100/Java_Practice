# map() in Stream API
- map() is an intermediate operation
- To perform one to one transformation map() method is used in stream API
- Each element in the input stream is transformed into a single corresponding element in the
  output stream

 -map() will perform certain operation with every element of stream()
 -map() method takes function as parameter and function() have apply() method.
 -map() will always return single output


# Flat Map in Stream API

- FlatMap is basically like map, but with an extra step: it flattens the nested structure produced by the mapping function
- If we have complex data in collection then we use flatMap()
- Collection which contains another collection
   Example:
            {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}

- flatmap() will return multiple output


# Reduce method in Stream API

- Reduce method is used for aggregating data.
- Aggregating means combine stream of elements and produces a single output.
- Reduce method takes Identity and accumulator as a argument.
- While dealing with steam of string we don't need to pass identity.

# mapToInt() method in stream API

- mapToInt() method returns Intstream values.
- mapToInt() transforms elements of stream of objects into stream of primitive int values.
