# Parallel Stream in jva

- Parallel streams are introduced in java 8 as a part of stream API
- They helps in executing collections parallelly by utilizing multicore processor and improving the
  performance.
- By default streams are sequential in nature but can be made parallel by invoking parallelStream() method
  on existing sequential stream or by invoking parallelStream() stream method from the scratch.
- Parallel stream divide the data into multiple sub streams, execute them in parallel using multiple
  threads from the ForkJoinPool and combine the result.
- This is helpful only when operations are independent of each other and can be executed concurrently.


# sequentialStream() vs parallelStream()

- sequentialStream() process elements in sequential manner, one element at a time
- parallelStream() process elements in parallel, utilizing multiple CPU cores.
