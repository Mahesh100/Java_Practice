# Multi threading in java

# Multitasking
- Performing multiple task at single time is called multitasking
- Multitasking increases the performance of CPU

- We can achieve multitasking by two ways :

    1) Process based multitasking  (Multi Processing)
    2) Thread based multitasking   (Multi Threading)

 1) Process Based multitasking (Multi Processing)
 - When one system is connected to multiple processors in order to complete the task.
 - It is best suitable at system level

   # Process (Program)[Ex VLC] :
   - Process is combination of multiple small small task (threads)
   -

 2) Thread based multitasking (Multi threading)

 # Thread:
   - Executing multiple threads at same time is called multithreading
   -

   Example :

   class VLC{
        public static void main(String [] args)
        {

        }

        class Video   (Thread 1)
        {
            void playVideo()
            {

            }
        }

        class Music  (Thread 2)
        {
            void startMusic()
            {

            }
        }
   }

   - Multi threading is best suitable is programming level
   - In java we have predefine API's for multithreading so we don't need to do internal coding, we have to implement only classes and interfaces
     to achieve multithreading in java

     Example : Thread class
               Runnable interface
               Thread Group class
               Concurrency package
               Thread pool (Executor framework)
