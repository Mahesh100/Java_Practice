- When new object of class is created using new keyword

   Laptop obj = new Laptop();         //Suppose Laptop is class

There are two memory areas in java :

# Heap Memory
- The actual object of class (Laptop class) i.e new Laptop() is created in heap memory area.

- Heap is used to store objects and instance variables.  (new Laptop is object here)

- JVM allocates memory in heap area dynamically at runtime.

# Stack Memory

- The reference variable obj is stored in the stack. (inside main method stack frame)

- The obj holds the memory address(reference) pointing to the actual object stored in heap.

   ** In simple words we can say, Objects are stored in heap and reference are stored in stack memory
      which are pointing to object in heap.


# Garbage collection
- Java uses Garage Collection to free heap memory when object are no longer referenced.
