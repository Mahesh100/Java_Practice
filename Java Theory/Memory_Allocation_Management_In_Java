- When we create new object of class using new keyword

   Laptop obj = new Laptop();

# Heap Memory
- The actual object of class (Laptop class) i.e new Laptop() is created in heap.

- Heap is used to store objects and instance variables

- JVM allocates memory for Laptop object here dynamically at runtime.

# Stack Memory

- The reference variable obj is stored in the stack(inside main method stack frame)

- The obj holds the memory address(reference) pointing to the actual object stored in heap.

   ** In simple words we can say, Objects are stored in heap and reference are stored in stack memory
      which are point to object in heap.

# Garbage collection

- Java uses Garage Collection to free heap memory when object are no longer referenced.
