# Stored Procedure : A stored procedure is prepared sql code that can be save so the
  code can be reused again and again.

 - So suppose we have sql query that we want to write again and again then just save it as
   stored procedure and call it to execute whenever needed.


  # syntax

  create procedure procedure_name
  as sql_statement Go;


  - Execute stored procedure.

  EXEC procedure_name

 # Find Nth highest salary from the employee table.

   In MySql we can use
       Select salary from employee order by salary desc limit 2,1;

       here 2 is number of index and 1 is number of rows to be fetched.

       Select salary from employee order by salary desc (N-1),1;

   In PostgresSql we can use offset and fetch clause :

      Select salary from employee order by salary desc offset 2 fetch first 1 row only

      Select salary from employee order by salary desc offset (N-1) fetch 1 row only;

 # Primary key is column in sql table which uniquely identify the record in table
 - We can have only one primary key for each table
 - Primary key does not have null values

 # Unique Constraints in SQL

 - Unique key is column or set of column that uniquely define the record
 - Unique constraints ensures that the all the values in specific columns is different.

- The main difference between a primary key vs unique key is that a primary key is a key that
  uniquely identifies each record in a table but cannot store NULL values.
  In contrast, a unique key prevents duplicate values in a column and can store NULL values.

 # Foreign key

 - Foreign key used to link one or more than one table together.
 - A foreign key is specified as a key that is related to primary key of another table.
