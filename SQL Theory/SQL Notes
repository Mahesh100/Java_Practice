 # Find Nth highest salary from the employee table.

   In MySql we can use
       Select salary from employee order by salary desc limit 2,1;

       here 2 is number of index and 1 is number of rows to be fetched.

       Select salary from employee order by salary desc (N-1),1;

   In PostgresSql we can use offset and fetch clause :

      Select salary from employee order by salary desc offset 2 fetch first 1 row only

      Select salary from employee order by salary desc offset (N-1) fetch 1 row only;
