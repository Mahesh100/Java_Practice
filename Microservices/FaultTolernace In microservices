# Fault tolerance

- Fault tolerance is the property of the system that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of
  failure of some of its components

- Fault can arise when one of the microservice is down

- In order to make a fault tolerance we have to configure a circuit breaker design patter

  So whenever a particular microservice is down we have to stop calling that microservice rather call a "Fall Back Method"
  which is configured.

- Circuit breaker hits/calls the microservice N number of times and how much time it should call the microservice
  that is also configurable.
